Provide concrete examples of how these principles could be applied on the manufacturing floor to monitor key process variables like solder temperature or component placement accuracy.\n\n•   Control Charts: Describe the function and application of at least two different types of\ncontrol charts (e.g., X-bar and R charts, or P charts) and explain how they are used to distinguish between common cause and special cause variation. Justify why this distinction is critical for process stability and improvement.\n\n•   Benefits of SPC: Argue for the implementation of SPC within the engineering\nenvironment. Focus your justification on how it can lead to improved product quality, reduced waste, and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\nb)  To provide a practical, industry-specific context, your report will also include a discussion\non:\n\n•   The \"Seven Basic Tools of Quality\": Select and explain how at least three of these\ntools (e.g., Pareto chart, Fishbone diagram, Histogram) can be used to analyze and solve quality-related problems in the electronics manufacturing process. For each tool, provide a specific example of its application.\n\n•   Cost of Quality (COQ) Model: Analyze the four main components of the COQ model\n(prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure costs). Using a real-world example from the electronics industry, demonstrate how an investment in prevention and appraisal costs can lead to a significant reduction in failure costs and a positive return on investment.",

Each driver is tested by quality control for the output voltage when connected to a constant load. The acceptable limits for the output voltage are between 11V and 15V. Any drivers that fall outside these limits are non-conforming and must be reworked or scrapped. The typical test results pre and post the introduction of quality control are shown in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1: Number of Drivers vs. Output Voltage\nOutput Voltage\n(V)\nBefore\nQC\nAfter\nQC\n< 5               5         1\n5 - 7              8         2\n7 - 9              15        5\n9 - 11             25        10\n11 - 13            60        85\n13 - 15            50        80\n15 - 17            25        15\n> 17              12        2\nTotal             200       200\n\nUsing the data from Table 2.1, create a comparative histogram or a dual-axis bar chart to visually represent the impact of implementing a quality control process.
