You must demonstrate your \ncore skills and knowledge. \n2 \nAI PLANNING \nAI may be used for pre- task activities such as brainstorming, outlining \nand initial research. This level focuses on the effective use of AI for \nplanning, synthesis, and ideation, but assessments should emphasise \nthe ability to develop and refine these ideas independently. \nYou may use AI for planning, idea \ndevelopment, and research. Your final \nsubmission should show how you have \ndeveloped and refined these ideas. \n3 \nAI \nCOLLABORATION \nAI may be used to help complete the task, including idea generation, \ndrafting, feedback, and refinement. Students should critically evaluate \nand modify the AI suggested outputs, demonstrating their \nunderstanding. \nYou may use AI to assist with specific tasks \nsuch as drafting text, refining and evaluating \nyour work. You must critically evaluate and \nmodify any AI-generated content you use. \n4 \nFULL AI \nAI may be used to complete any elements of the task, with students \ndirecting AI to achieve the assessment goals. Assessments at this level \nmay also require engagement with AI to achieve goals and solve \nproblems. \nYou may use AI extensively throughout your \nwork either as you wish, or as specifically \ndirected in your assessment. Focus on \ndirecting AI to achieve your goals while \ndemonstrating your critical thinking. \n5 \nAI EXPLORATION \nAI is used creatively to enhance problem-solving, generate novel \ninsights, or develop innovative solutions to solve problems. Students \nand educators co -design assessments to explore unique AI applications \nwithin the field of study. \nYou should use AI creatively to solve the \ntask, potentially co -designing new \napproaches with your instructor.\f\n\n© 202 5 UniCourse Ltd. All Rights Reserved \nPage 2 of 5 \nIssue 2 - 202 5 /2 6 \nReferences \n• Prepare your references and correctly cite them within the body of your assignment using zbib.org . \n• Use the Harvard referencing standard of any of the listed UK universities. \n• In zbib.org , create a ‘Link to this Version’ and copy it into your References section. \n• Assignments will be rejected if this process is not followed correctly. \nSubmission Format \nAll text elements of your submission should be word processed, mathematical solutions can be handwritten \n(neatly) and scanned into your document. \nAssignment Format \n• Organisation : Use clear headings, paragraphs, and sub -sections, to ensure clarity and ease of reading. \nRefer to Task numbers or sections to make it clear which question you are answering. Assignment \nStructure \nYour assignment MUST include the following sections: \n• Cover Page : Your Course, Name, Unit Name and Assignment number/name \n• Contents Page : List tasks or questions with page numbers. \n• References : Correctly cite and list all sources used, but do not use Wikipedia. Please see the detailed \nadvice on page 1. \nSubmission Requirements \nBy submitting your assignment, you confirm the following: \n• Originality : The work is your own, with all sources properly cited. \n• Plagiarism : You acknowledge that plagiarism and collusion are forms of academic misconduct and are \nstrictly prohibited. \n• Plagiarism Detection : Your assignment will be submitted to TurnItIn, a plagiarism detection service, \nthat compares your work against databases, online sources, and other students' work. \n• False Declaration : Making a false declaration is academic misconduct.\f\n\n© 202 5 UniCourse Ltd.
