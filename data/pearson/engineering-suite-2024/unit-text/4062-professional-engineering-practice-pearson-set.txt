Unit 4062: Professional Engineering
Practice
Unit Code: M/651/0803
Level: 4
Credits: 15
Introduction
The work of the engineer is key to the development and progress of our society.
The decisions they make in the course of their everyday work can be life-changing in
positive ways or, if poorly made, can be life-threatening. Accordingly, the engineer
must work to strict codes of professionalism in all aspects of their work.
This unit outlines the background to the legislation, professional codes of practice
and operational competencies that underpin the development of the professional
engineer. It also considers the roles of problem-solving, communication, team
working and professional responsibility.
Elements of personal and professional development, reflective thinking, career
planning and leadership are considered as well. The increasing necessity for a holistic
approach to sustainability in design, manufacture, and reuse and recycling are
emphasised.
On successful completion of this unit, the student will be well prepared for further
study at levels 5 and 6, working towards membership of an appropriate professional
institution at Incorporated Engineer level.

Essential Content
LO1 Determine the roles, responsibilities and competences of the professional
engineer
Role of the professional engineer:
Transforming ideas and materials into products and services: design, build, test
and improve; consideration of the whole life cycle of the output of the engineer’s
work, including sustainability and end-of-life provision of recycling and reuse.
Responsibilities:
The importance of proper risk identification, assessment and mitigation;
appropriate safety factors; examples of discipline-specific failures due to poor
engineering/lack of proper ‘what if’ procedures
Understanding that human factors affect engineering processes
Adherence to codes of conduct; acting with due care, skill and diligence by
recognising appropriate behaviours and possible limitations; preventing
avoidable dangers/adverse impact on the environment; enhancing operational
competence
The importance of considering the effects of certain behaviours and values:
attitude, persuasion, coercion, rapport, authority
Effects of external influences: stress, time pressure, fatigue, memory, capability,
motivation, knowledge, experience, health, alcohol, drugs and criminal behaviour
Personal and corporate privacy and security.
Competences:
Digital skills and industrial digitalisation technologies (IDTs); research skills −
find, extract, organise, analyse, evaluate and use or present relevant information;
project planning and management (i.e., change management, compliance in
delivering outputs, responsible planning and work prioritisation, predictive
maintenance); financial literacy (e.g.
financial planning, data, reporting); individual and team approaches to solving
problems and risk management through use of methods such as Fishbone,
practical problem solving (PPS), root cause analysis (RCA), advanced Product
Quality Planning (APQP) and process failure mode effects analysis (PFMEA);
project management techniques (e.g. SWOT, stakeholder matrices, risk mapping,
radar chart and summary risk profiles), time management, organisation and
record-keeping; sketching, drawing, use and interpretation of computer-aided
design (CAD)

Professional engineering capabilities: installation, commissioning, shut-down,
start-up and maintenance/service/support of a wide range of systems and
devices; use of relevant manufacturing and production methods; ability to follow
and apply latest trends in engineering and manufacturing (e.g., lean methods
and tools used in manufacturing and engineering such as Kaizen, Six Sigma,
8 wastes, 5S’s and Poka-Yoke), commitment to upskilling/reskilling, and
continued professional development.
Reflective practice: cycle of reflection in action and on action, refining ongoing
professional practice (future behaviour), setting goals, reviewing again to achieve
sustainable performance; evaluation of own and others’ work
Avoidance of generalisation; focus on personal development in a critical and
objective way.
LO2 Describe the regulatory, legislative and ethical frameworks that govern the
work of the professional engineer
Regulatory and legislative frameworks:
Global, European and national regulatory influences on engineering and the
role/occupation of the engineer (e.g. the Royal Academy of Engineering and
the Engineering Council in the UK); role and responsibilities of the Engineering
Council and professional engineering institutions (PEIs), UK Standard for
Professional Engineering Competence (UKSPEC), or international equivalents
Relevant health and safety standards, codes and regulations; principles of
functional machinery and/or process safety, including SIL (safety integrated level)
and PL (performance level) terminology; appropriate sector legislation for quality
control/assurance and management (e.g. electrical safety system legislation
and directives, emissions, construction and use, environmental legislation,
UN Sustainable Development Goals, British Standards Institution (BSI) and
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards e.g. ISO 14090:
2019 Adaptation to climate change)
Responsibilities at various levels of engineering (e.g. Engineering Council
Technical, Incorporated and Chartered Engineer professional registration levels,
or international equivalent) including secure operations and application of
appropriate processes, policies and legislation in the context of business goals,
vision and values; responsible selection of tools/techniques in upgrading and
maintaining systems; resilience in undertaking tasks and working securely within
the business.
Ethical frameworks:
The Engineering Council and The Royal Academy of Engineering’s Statement of
Ethical Principles; The National Society for Professional Engineers’ Code of Ethics.

LO3 Review the roles of communication, team working and leadership in the
development of professional engineers
Communication:
Listening, non-verbal communication, clarity and brevity, friendliness, role of
humour; confidence, empathy, open-mindedness, respect, feedback and picking
the right medium for presentations
Presentation skills, use of presentation software, summaries and presentation
notes.
Team working:
Group expectations, dealing with reactions and disagreements, allowing and
encouraging participation, acting on agreed outcomes; the negative effects of
communication without cause; disillusioned colleagues, persuasion and
negotiation
Rewarding and motivating; peer assessment of work, mentoring at regular

Manufacture (DFM), Design for Assembly (DFA) and Design for Disassembly
(DFD) as more holistic optimisations of product design to reduce complexity;
simplification of assembly and finishing processes by design; quality assurance
by design to ensure operation, consistency and quantification of enhancement
of manufacturing and process applications
