Unit 4068: Industrial Robots
Unit code L/617/3940
Unit level 4
Credit 15
Introduction
Industrial robotics is the present and future of automated manufacturing and is an
unstoppable reality. With the emergence of lighter, smarter and safer industrial robot
models that are increasingly easy to interface, the demand has never been so high
and is expected to grow year on year. Popular applications for industrial robots
include welding, painting, assembly and materials handling. Modern industrial robots
are now an integral part of cyber-physical mechatronic systems contributing to
Industry 4.0 manufacturing.
The aim of this unit is for students to investigate the range, operation and benefits of
industrial robots within manufacturing applications. Among the topics included are
industrial robot selection, and programming and safety protocols that anticipate
future developments in industrial robot technology.
On successful completion of this unit students will have an understanding of the
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic operation of common industrial
robots, how to select and program an industrial robot for a given requirement,
taking account of safety considerations, and how to assess the economic future
of robot technologies in manufacturing.
