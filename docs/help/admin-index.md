# `/admin` Help

## Purpose

Admin control tower for operations.
Use this page to monitor blockers, jump into QA research, and open audit/locking workflows.

## Key Areas

- Header quick actions
- KPI metrics
- Attention queue
- Grade distribution snapshot
- Recent references and recent submissions
- Top-nav admin sections:
  - Overview, Audit, Briefs, Library, QA, Specs, Students, Users
  - Settings (cog icon on far-right)

  - `/admin/reference`
  - `/admin/bindings`

## Recommended Flow

1. Check `Open blockers` and `Needs attention now`.
2. Resolve locking and extraction issues first.
3. Open `/admin/qa` for outcome analysis and report export.
4. Open `/admin/audit` to verify event-level evidence for any anomalies.
