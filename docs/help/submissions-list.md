# Submissions List (`/submissions`)

Last updated: 2026-02-20

Use this page as the operations queue.

## Primary Actions

- filter by lane/status/search
- use `Upload assignment` to add new evidence
- run `Grade auto-ready` for the automation-safe queue
- open `Batch actions` for secondary batch controls
- resolve student links
- run QA preview/commit
- retry failed rows after fixes
- open row detail for deep review
- monitor Turnitin AI badges (`AI <n>%` or `AI pending`) when available

## Lane Intent

- `Auto-ready`: automation-safe
- `Needs Human`: manual review required
- `Blocked`: do not grade yet
- `Completed`: finished runs

## Rule

Treat this page as queue control, not grading detail. Use `/submissions/[submissionId]` for full evidence review.
