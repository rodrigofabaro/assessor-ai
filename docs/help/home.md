# `/` Home Dashboard Help

## Purpose

Landing page to enter the platform quickly and see high-level status.

## Main actions

- `Go to Upload` -> start submission intake.
- `Go to Admin` -> manage specs/briefs/settings/audit.
- Navigate cards:
  - Upload
  - Specs
  - Briefs
  - Students
  - Submissions

## How to use

1. Check status cards to confirm system readiness.
2. If doing day-to-day marking, go to `Upload` or `Submissions`.
3. If preparing references, go to `Admin` first.

## Typical issue

- Counts look stale:
  - refresh browser page
  - confirm DB is reachable and app is running on expected environment
