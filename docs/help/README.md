# Help Center Content (Route-by-Route)

This folder is written to be re-used as an in-app Help center.

Each file explains:
- what the page is for
- what key controls do
- the normal operator flow
- common issues and fixes

## Help Index

- `home.md` -> `/`
- `upload.md` -> `/upload`
- `submissions-list.md` -> `/submissions`
- `submission-detail.md` -> `/submissions/[submissionId]`
- `students-pages.md` -> `/students/[id]`, `/admin/students`
- `admin-index.md` -> `/admin`
- `admin-specs.md` -> `/admin/specs`
- `admin-briefs.md` -> `/admin/briefs`, `/admin/briefs/[briefId]`
- `admin-reference.md` -> `/admin/reference`
- `admin-library.md` -> `/admin/library`
- `admin-bindings.md` -> `/admin/bindings`
- `admin-settings.md` -> `/admin/settings`
- `admin-audit-users.md` -> `/admin/audit`, `/admin/users`

## Navigation note

- Primary admin top-nav sections are:
  - `Audit`, `Briefs`, `Library`, `Overview`, `QA`, `Settings`, `Specs`, `Students`, `Users`
- Advanced admin pages are still available via direct URL:
  - `/admin/reference`
  - `/admin/bindings`

## Notes

- This is user-facing operational help, not implementation internals.
- API route docs are intentionally excluded from this pack.
