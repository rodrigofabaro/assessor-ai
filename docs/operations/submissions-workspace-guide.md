## What This Page Is

Queue control for intake, linking, triage, and batch workflows.

## What This Page Is Not

It is not the final place to validate detailed criterion evidence. Use submission detail for that.

## Recommended Queue Order

1. Blocked
2. Needs Human
3. QA review
4. Auto-ready
5. Completed

## Batch Safety

- use QA preview before QA commit
- do not batch grade rows with unresolved blockers
- always review skipped reasons from batch result

## Known UX Pressure Points

- dense controls can hide key actions on smaller viewports
- lane card density can require excess scrolling
- right-side controls can crowd evidence workspace
