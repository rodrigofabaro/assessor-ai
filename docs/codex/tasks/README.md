# Codex tasks

This folder is for **examples and archived task write‑ups**, not live tickets.

Rules:
- Prefer creating new tasks in your issue tracker / PR description.
- Keep only a small number of examples here.
- Move old tasks into `archive/` when they become historical.

Use the template at `docs/codex/TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
