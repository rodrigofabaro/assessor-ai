    "feedbackText": "The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of engineering design principles and effectively meets several key criteria. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in the evaluation and justification of design choices.\n- The design specification is well-structured and aligns with the brief.\n- Stakeholder requirements are adequately addressed, but further detail could enhance clarity.\n- The project schedule is clear, though the planning techniques could be more thoroughly evaluated.\n- The technical report is comprehensive, yet it lacks a critical assessment of compliance and risk management.\n- Communication strategies are presented, but reflection on their effectiveness is limited.",
